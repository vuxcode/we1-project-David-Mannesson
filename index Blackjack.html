      <h2> Blackjack Page Test Subtitle</h2>
      <p>
        There's a good reason I jokingly call my program "I can belive it's not Blackjack" in the Home section, because it isn't Blackjack. It is a simple card game loosly inspired by the far more complex Blackjack. So, to show how sorry I am for having mislead you, dear reader, I will give you some tips and tricks for playing actual Blackjack.<br>
        Well... technically I'll be "borrowing" said tips and tricks from someone actually qualified to give them, one Mr Vlad Grindu, editor and gambling analyst for the educational website Technopedia. All following Italic text is directly quoted from Mr Grindu's writing.<br>

        <h3>Always Stand on 17+</h3>
        <p>
          The first rule in blackjack is to stand on a hard 17, or higher. Even if the dealer is showing an Ace or 10, it is best to hold the hand, rather than trying to improve it further given the small number of cards that can be beneficial.
        </p>
        <h3>Double Down on 11</h3>
        <p>
          A hard 11, made out of the first two cards you've been dealt, is one of the best starting hands in blackjack and you can take advantage of that by doubling down. This will help you make the most of the situation and maximize winning hands in the long run.
        </p>
        <h3>Only Stand with 12 on Dealer's 4, 5, or 6</h3>
        <p>
          In this spot, the blackjack perfect strategy requires you to stand only when the dealer is showing a 4, 5, or 6. Otherwise, the correct move is to hit since his hole card will likely result in a hand stronger than 12.

        Well, that's enough for now I think. If you want to read more of Mr Grindu's tips and tricks, you'll find more on Technopedia.com. Yes, I could have put a link here, but as is clearly written on the Home page, I don't enjoy HTML coding.
