# Project Notes

# Project Summary

> What I have made is a simple text & image website, containing information both about the Programming 1 project, as well as Blackjack in general. Nothing fancy

> I have learnt that HTML-CSS is a objectively bad programming language which doesn't make sense. On a more serious note, I've learnt the basics of HTML-CSS and that I neither enjoy it or am especially good at it. Though I will admit I am quite happy with the logo and general design language of the website (aka. the two things that didn't invlove HTML-CSS). 

> I would have wanted to maybe play around a bit more with the design, to see if that could be improved. Also, just fleshing out the text a bit more would give the site more value as well as improving the look a tad. Finally, I would also have wanted to figure out a way to get the sticky footer to actually work in a way that didn't reduce site functionality.

> I can safely say that I stayed in budget, since I know that I didn't spend nearly enough time at this project.
