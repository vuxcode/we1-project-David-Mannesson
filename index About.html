        <h2> About the Program</h2>
        <p>
          Here I will talk about the Programming 1 program, mainly the AI logic.<br>
          First and formost we must undertstand the standard turn function. It stards with something called the "lucky" function. It is said function which contains the AI logic when both players are still in the game. In this case there a two ways in which the program will chose to draw new cards.<br>
          First, if the dealer is bellow the total value of 12, then it will draw another card. The risk of going bust by drawing another card is so low that it is always worth drawing another card, unless the human player has stood, but that is controlled by another set of logic.<br>
          Second is the dealer being lower than the human player and bellow a total of 17. In this case it is judged that the risk of drawing another cards with the goal being to surpass the human player is worth it. If the number is 17 or aboven, the program will instead hedge its bets on the human player going bust. <br>
          Finally, if the player chooses to stand, then the computer can continue drawing cards independently. In this case, not having to take the player into consideration, the logic becomes simpler. As long as the dealer itself hasn't already stood (in which case the player also standing would immediatly lead to the winner being decided) then the program will continue drawing cards for as long as it remains lower or equal to the human player.
